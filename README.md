sqlite
DBBrowser



here i m using sqlite database , if u want to use xampp , just add the detail about database ,password in the 39th line , u can refer some youtube channel incase if u have any query.

if u use sqlite , install sqlite and dbbrowser to view the table , i recommend u to use this , because sqlite is lightweight compare to other tools.


The admin username and pwd are static , that is mention in the line 343,344 in app.py
admin name : admin@123
admin password : admin@pwd

you can able to change the admin name and pwd in 343,344 lines in app.py file

you can able to change the entire project to e-commerce platform , to simple modification in the code

And finally the html and css are not responsive in many places, so use in desktop or lap, change the code as your wish.
